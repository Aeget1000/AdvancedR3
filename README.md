# AdvancedR3: If it can not be reproduced why do it in the first place

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is about a analysis of lipidomics data for me to learn how
to mange my project like a champ

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, docs and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: Holds the lipidomics.csv file from the experiment.
-   `docs/`: Holds all documents.
-   `R/`: Holds all R related dev or source functions.

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
